           <p> in self-driving vehicle/driverless vehicle, traffic planning and traffic observation.
               Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) framework is a segment of Driving Assistance System (ADAS).  
               The TSR framework helps the drivers in safe driving as street signs give significant data of the street.
               The car business has built up a great deal and a portion of the organizations are attempting to assemble
               self-sufficient vehicles and in which traffic sign acknowledgment is one of the significant factors to be
               thought of. To perceive the traffic signs, a model utilizing convolutional neural network is fabricated and
               this model will perceive the traffic signs. This model can likewise be utilized in typical vehicles to caution 
               the driver about traffic signs through content identification.</p>

            <P>
                Financial services are being used everywhere and
function with high complexity. With the increase in the usage
of online modes for transacting throughout the world it is seen
that the frauds too are increasing alarmingly in this sector. An
automated Fraud Detection System is thus required to tackle
this issue. Over the years, many techniques are being tried in
order to efficiently tackle this issue. With millions of transactions
taking place it is practically impossible to take care of this by
manually checking for frauds.With that being said, speed and
accuracy is needed while building such systems. Our system not
only works in these areas but also provides better accuracy which
in-turn will end up saving a lot of resources and the cost incurred.
Our aim with this research is to provide a robust, cost effective,
efficient yet accurate solution to detect frauds in both online
payment transactions and payments that take place with credit
cards. The proposed solution is a Machine Learning model that
will serve the purpose of detecting “fraudulent” and “genuine”
transactions in real time. This is beneficial for all sectors that
are even mildly aligned to finance or make use of it. The solution
will help them analyse based on various factors if the ongoing
transaction can be harmful and will prevent many unfortunate
incidents.
